	My name is Phil Forrence. I've never used HTML or CSS. That first class was <em>confusing</em>. I'm a senior. I basically just do COE so I can make money. It's interesting and cool, but I realized I don't love it about 3/4 of my way through my degree.

	My passion is comedy! I'm a stand-up. I perform all over town pretty much every night. My dream is to make a career out of it. Don't tell anyone, though, because then they look at me differently. They either laugh at banal things I say or repeatedly ask me to tell them a joke.
